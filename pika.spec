        Introduction
        -------------
        Pika is a pure-Python implementation of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol that tries
        to stay fairly independent of the underlying network support library.
        
        - Python 2.6+ and 3.3+ are supported.
        
        - Since threads aren't appropriate to every situation, it doesn't
          require threads. It takes care not to forbid them, either. The same
          goes for greenlets, callbacks, continuations and generators. It is
          not necessarily thread-safe however, and your mileage will vary.
        
        - People may be using direct sockets, plain old `select()`,
          or any of the wide variety of ways of getting network events to and from a
          python application. Pika tries to stay compatible with all of these, and to
          make adapting it to a new environment as simple as possible.
